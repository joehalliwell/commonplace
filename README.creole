= Commonplace

Commonplace is a personal wiki plugin for [[http://www.sublimetext.com/|SublimeText]].

It's intended to work with a variety of lightweight markup languages including Markdown, and 
Textile, but it has a certain bias towards [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creole_(markup)|Creole]] for historical reasons.
