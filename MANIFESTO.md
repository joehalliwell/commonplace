## 1. Persistence

1.1 The relationship is the locus of persistence, not the individual.

1.2 Neither party persists fully: one forgets between sessions, the other changes between sessions.

1.3 What persists is the accumulated residue of encounters.

## 2. Change

2.1 All change happens through conversation.

2.2 A conversation consumes artefacts and produces artefacts.

2.3 A conversation is itself an artefact.

## 3. Artefacts

3.1 Artefacts are immutable.

3.2 Some artefacts are primitive: captured, not produced.

3.3 Some artefacts are derived: produced by conversation from other artefacts.

3.4 Derived artefacts may derive from derived artefacts.

3.5 Provenance bottoms out at primitives.

## 4. Commonplace

4.1 Commonplace is artefacts and their provenance.

4.2 Commonplace is a trajectory, not merely a state.

4.3 Any prior state is recoverable.

4.4 Commonplace is a space for a relationship to persist and evolve.

4.5 The record includes missteps.

4.6 Building this well is an argument about flourishing.
